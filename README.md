# Lab Rules and Hints 

  This is a collection of rules and hints (on various different subjects) for members of the COMBINE lab. Others may also find them useful.
  
Making use of version control
=============================

GitHub has generously provided the COMBINE lab with an organization account.  This gives us the ability to create a significant number of private repositories as well as an unlimited number of public repositories.  This is a tremendous resource, and I am adamant that we make use of it.  This means that every project you work on should have a GitHub repository under the COMBINE lab origanization.  This repository should contain all of the code (main source code, scripts, etc. --- but not data) for the project.  Git is built around a commit-early / commit-often philosophy, and you should adhere to that.
